Here are all the files related to the idol dataset. 

1. `.bin` files are the outputs from the COLMAP software given the images.
2. `.npy` and `.json` files are related to the converted COLMAP outputs which will be used to generate the poses.
3. `.pth` stores the model weights for the best results.

`.npz` file, which stores the poses in a compressed numpy format, will be generated by the `load_dataset.ipynb` notebook, and this should be used as input for the `model.ipynb` notebook.
